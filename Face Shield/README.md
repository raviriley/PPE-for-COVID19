To get started, print out a `0.5in spacer.stl` for your holepuncher. If you'll be printing face shield frames one at a time, download [`Face Shield Frame.stl`](). If you want to print stacks of face shields, explore the stacks folder or click [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=4311414) to generate your own custom stacks on Thingiverse Customizer. If you have OpenSCAD, download [`run locally.zip`]() to generate your own custom stacks locally. I suggest rendering locally, as it'll be a lot faster than using Thingiverse Customizer since these are quite large files.
