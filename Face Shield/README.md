To get started, print out a [`0.5in spacer.stl`](https://github.com/raviriley/PPE-for-COVID19/blob/master/Face%20Shield/0.5in%20spacer.stl) for your holepuncher. If you'll be printing face shield frames one at a time, download [`Face Shield Frame.stl`](https://github.com/raviriley/PPE-for-COVID19/blob/master/Face%20Shield/Face%20Shield%20Frame.stl). If you want to print stacks of face shields, explore the stacks folder or click [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=4311414) to generate your own custom stacks on Thingiverse Customizer. If you have OpenSCAD, download [`run locally.zip`](https://github.com/raviriley/PPE-for-COVID19/raw/master/Face%20Shield/3D%20Printing%20Stacks/Customizable%20stack%20generator%20(for%20single%20extrusion)/run%20locally.zip) to generate your own custom stacks locally. I suggest rendering locally, as it'll be a lot faster than using Thingiverse Customizer since these are quite large files.
